        <span class="v1_16">
          “Our children are our greatest treasure… Those who abuse them tear at
          the fabric of our society and weaken our nation.” Nelson Mandela’s
          words remind us that child abuse is more than just a personal
          tragedy—it’s a quiet force that can destroy entire communities. Under
          SDG 16—Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions—ending child abuse is a
          global priority. Think of society as a living body, and children as
          its vital cells. When those cells are damaged, the whole system starts
          to fail. And if the harm spreads—if hurt children grow up carrying
          pain, anger, and fear—we risk a future built on broken foundations.
